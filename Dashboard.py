    This is a demo **Knowledge Base** app built with **Streamlit** as the *frontend* and  **Amazon Opensearch** as the underlying *search engine*. 
    The app is hosted on AWS and uses API Gateway and Lambda to connect the frontend app with the Opensearch.

    Since the app is hosted on AWS for *demo purpose only*, you **must not** use this app for any real use cases. You can look around and 
    get inspired on how to implement ADD, GET, UPDATE, and SEARCH with Streamlit. You can also **use the code for free** to create 
    and host your own knowledge base/search engine. ðŸŽ†
